# ðŸš€ Node.js 30-Day Learning Journey

As a **SAPUI5 developer**, I know JavaScript very well and now I want to go further.  
So, I started learning deeper into backend-supported frameworks and languages.  
For that, my first step is **Node.js**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Whatever I learn about Node.js, I will **write as an article** and also upload my **practice code** in this repository.

## ðŸ“š Goals

- Learn **Node.js fundamentals** (core modules, HTTP, file handling)  
- Build APIs with **Express.js**  
- Connect to **MongoDB** and handle authentication  
- Practice advanced concepts like middleware, JWT, streams, and WebSockets  
- Deploy a real-world project by the end of the journey

## ðŸ—“ 30-Day Node.js Roadmap (Day-by-Day)

### Days 1â€“5: Core Node.js
- Install Node.js & npm
- Learn built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `http`, `os`)
- Create a CLI tool (e.g., word counter or joke generator)
- Build a simple HTTP server
- Practice file handling (read/write/update with `fs`)

### Days 6â€“10: Express Basics
- Setup an Express app
- Build routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Work with middleware (logging, error handling)
- Serve static files
- Mini Project: **To-do API**

### Days 11â€“15: APIs & Databases
- Learn REST API best practices
- Use Postman/Insomnia to test APIs
- Connect Express with MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- CRUD operations with MongoDB
- Project: **Blog API** with posts & comments

### Days 16â€“20: Authentication
- Learn about sessions & cookies
- Implement JWT authentication
- Secure routes with middleware
- Hash passwords with `bcrypt`
- Project: Add **user login/register** to Blog API

### Days 21â€“25: Advanced Node.js
- Request validation (`joi` or `express-validator`)
- File uploads with `multer`
- Streams & Buffers
- EventEmitter
- Mini Project: **File uploader with streams**

### Days 26â€“30: Real-World & Deployment
- Real-time communication with WebSockets (`socket.io`)
- Testing with Jest/Mocha + Supertest
- Environment variables with `dotenv`
- Deployment (Render, Railway, Vercel, or Docker)
- Final Project: Deploy **Blog API / Chat App / Task Manager**
